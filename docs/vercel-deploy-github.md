# AI Guideline — Deploy a Site via GitHub (Vercel)

A prescriptive, copy-ready guideline for an AI agent implementing
**GitHub-connected deployments** through the Vercel REST API.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Trigger a deployment from a GitHub repository ref or commit SHA
- Attach git metadata so Vercel links the deployment to the commit
- Poll `readyState` until the deployment reaches `READY` or `ERROR`
- Surface the live URL back to the user

**Out of scope:**

- How the access token was obtained (see `vercel-connect.md`)
- GitHub authentication / repo access (the user's Vercel account must already
  have the GitHub app installed and the repo connected to a Vercel project)
- Building or bundling code locally (Vercel's build system does this)
- File-upload deployments (see `vercel-deploy-files.md`)

> The single deliverable of this flow is: **a `READY` deployment triggered from
> a specific GitHub commit, with a live `url`.** The caller provides a
> `repoId`/`ref`/`sha`; this flow handles everything from trigger to URL.

## Mental model

```
CALLER              OUR SERVER                         VERCEL API          GITHUB
  │ deploy(repo,ref) ──►│                                   │                 │
  │                     │ POST /v13/deployments ───────────►│                 │
  │                     │  { gitSource: { type:"github",    │                 │
  │                     │    repoId, ref, sha } }           │ clone repo ────►│
  │                     │                                   │◄── source ──────│
  │                     │ returns deployment (QUEUED) ◄──── │                 │
  │                     │                                   │                 │
  │                     │ poll GET /v13/deployments/:id ───►│                 │
  │                     │   until readyState = READY|ERROR  │                 │
  │                     │◄── { url, readyState } ───────────│                 │
  │◄── url ────────────│                                   │                 │
```

Key difference from file-upload: **there is no Step 1.** Vercel clones the
repository itself using the GitHub app credentials attached to the user's
account. You only need to tell Vercel _which commit_ to build.

Two invariants:

1. **The Vercel project must already be linked to the GitHub repo.** If it
   isn't, the deployment will fail with a 404 or permission error. Linking is
   a one-time setup done in the Vercel dashboard or via the Projects API —
   not in this flow.
2. **`repoId`, not repo name.** Use GitHub's numeric repository ID (stable
   across renames) not the `owner/repo` slug. Obtain it once and store it in
   `user_integration.credentials`.

## Prerequisites

| Variable              | Purpose                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `VERCEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Bearer token from the OAuth flow                 |
| `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`      | Optional — required when deploying to a team     |

Additionally, the caller must supply:

| Input        | Type   | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `projectId`  | string | Vercel project ID (e.g. `prj_...`) or project slug   |
| `repoId`     | number | GitHub numeric repo ID                                |
| `ref`        | string | Branch or tag name (e.g. `"main"`, `"v1.2.3"`)       |
| `sha`        | string | Full 40-char commit SHA to deploy                     |
| `target`     | string | `"production"` or omit for preview                   |

---

## Step 1 — Create the deployment

```
POST https://api.vercel.com/v13/deployments
  ?teamId=<VERCEL_TEAM_ID>          ← omit if personal account
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "<project-slug>",
  "project": "<projectId>",
  "gitSource": {
    "type": "github",
    "repoId": 123456789,            ← numeric GitHub repo ID
    "ref": "main",                  ← branch or tag
    "sha": "dc36199b2234c6586ebe05ec94078a895c707e29"
  },
  "gitMetadata": {
    "remoteUrl": "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>",
    "commitRef": "main",
    "commitSha": "dc36199b2234c6586ebe05ec94078a895c707e29",
    "commitMessage": "<your commit message>",
    "commitAuthorName": "<author>",
    "commitAuthorEmail": "<email>"
  },
  "target": "production"           ← or omit for "preview"
}
```

**`gitMetadata` is optional but recommended** — it makes the deployment appear
correctly in the Vercel dashboard (commit message, author, branch) and is
required if you want to show deployment status back on the GitHub commit.

**Response:** a deployment object with `id`, `url`, and `readyState` (initially
`QUEUED` or `INITIALIZING`). Persist `id` immediately.

---

## Step 2 — Poll readyState

Identical to the file-upload flow:

```
GET https://api.vercel.com/v13/deployments/<id>
  ?teamId=<VERCEL_TEAM_ID>
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Poll on a **10-second interval** (GitHub builds take longer than static file
deployments — typically 1–5 minutes). Use exponential back-off, cap at 60 s.

| `readyState`   | Action                                             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `QUEUED`       | Wait, keep polling                                 |
| `INITIALIZING` | Wait, keep polling                                 |
| `BUILDING`     | Wait, keep polling (this state lasts longest)      |
| `READY`        | Done — read `url` from response, surface to caller |
| `ERROR`        | Read `errorMessage` / `errorCode`, surface failure |
| `CANCELED`     | Treat as failure                                   |

**Timeout:** abort polling after 20 minutes and surface a timeout error. GitHub
builds include install + build steps which can be slow on first run.

---

## Step 3 — Surface the result

On `READY`:

```ts
return {
  status: "ready",
  url: `https://${deployment.url}`,
  deploymentId: deployment.id,
  inspectorUrl: deployment.inspectorUrl,
  gitSource: deployment.gitSource,  // echoed back: { sha, ref, repoId }
}
```

On `ERROR`:

```ts
return {
  status: "error",
  errorMessage: deployment.errorMessage,
  errorCode: deployment.errorCode,
  deploymentId: deployment.id,
  inspectorUrl: deployment.inspectorUrl,
}
```

---

## Redeploying the latest commit on a branch

If you want to always deploy the latest commit on a branch (rather than a
pinned SHA), use `withLatestCommit`:

```json
{
  "name": "<project-slug>",
  "project": "<projectId>",
  "deploymentId": "<previous-dpl_...>",
  "withLatestCommit": true
}
```

This forces Vercel to fetch the latest SHA on the branch even when providing
a `deploymentId`. Useful for "deploy HEAD of main" UX.

## Comparing file-upload vs GitHub flow

| Concern               | File upload                        | GitHub                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Who builds the code?  | You do (locally)                   | Vercel (clones + runs build cmd)    |
| Step 1                | Upload files (per-file POST)       | None — just the deployment POST     |
| Input                 | Build output directory             | Repo ID + branch + SHA              |
| Build time            | Fast (static files only)           | Slower (installs deps, runs build)  |
| Git history visible?  | No                                 | Yes (Vercel dashboard shows commit) |
| Framework detection   | You set `framework: null`          | Vercel auto-detects from repo       |
| Re-use unchanged files| Yes (SHA dedup)                    | Yes (layer cache in build system)   |
| Requires GitHub app   | No                                 | Yes (installed on Vercel account)   |

---

## Error reference

| HTTP | Likely cause                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 400  | Missing `name`, bad `gitSource`, auto-detection mismatch    |
| 401  | Token expired or revoked — re-run connect flow               |
| 403  | GitHub app not installed or repo not linked to Vercel project|
| 404  | `repoId` not found or project not found                      |
| 409  | Concurrent identical deployment already in progress          |
| 429  | Rate limit — back off and retry                              |

## Content/design rollout

Apply and verify [the database migration](template-content-design-migration.md)
before deploying the new runtime. Modules now accept `{ content, design }`;
the engine reads both published columns together with 60-second ISR. Single-template
packages include `templates/resolve.ts` and both module defaults, with no dependency
on the excluded schema registry. Publishing validates both datasets and mirrors
Travel One colors into published content so older engines keep working. Draft saves
do not change published pages. No remote migration or redeployment is automatic.
